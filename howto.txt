1. Clone this directory
git clone https://github.com/m-rubik/Grow-Space.git

2. Open the directory
cd Grow-Space

3. If you don't already have pipenv, install it:
pip install pipenv

IF on rpi:
	Delete the tkinter requirement in pipfile

4. Install the virtual environment from the Pipfile
pipenv install --sequential

Possibly you might need to do:
sudo nano .env
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:src

If it fails to launch debugger open settings.json
and change "python.terminal.activateEnvironment" to False
